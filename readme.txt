This is a really simple project done in four days (5hours/day => 20hours)

I hope it could help people begin with libgdx ! Anyway, this project is bound to be continued.

Tutorial :

You have slime that should avoid the walls and get the slime with the same color to gain XP (to gain level/life). 
If you catch a slime without matching the color with him, you lose a level, just like taking a wall.
You can alternate colors of your slime to match.
